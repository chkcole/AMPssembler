The purpose of this program is to reconstitute complete barcoded cDNA transcripts from a mixture of sequenced libraries.
The Program works by collecting all reads associated with a single barcoded cDNA, creating high quality ends through
sequence consensus and then extending those ends with kmers until the other end is reached.
